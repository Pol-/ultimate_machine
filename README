Firmware for PIC10F220 based Ultimate Machine.
The goal of this project is to create something useless and fun at the same time.

REQUIRED SOFTWARE:
This code has been written under GNU/Linux.
Therfore the following software is needed:
* gputils (from your distro repository)
* pk2cmd (from microchip website)
Gpasm is fully compatible with mpasm so buildng under windows should be straightforward.
However you are on your own as I have no machine running windows handy.

HOW TO BUILD:
A makefile is provided for compiling and downlading the firmware on the PIC10F220.
The command 'make' builds and downloads the software on the part.
To run the software on the microcontroller execute 'make run'.
If just a rebuild of the surce is desired run 'make build'.
